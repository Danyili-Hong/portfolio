## Projects
### Predictive Modeling and Data-Driven Habitat Management for Small Mammal Populations in Eco Preserve

In this project, I applied advanced data analysis techniques using R to explore and model small mammal population trends for Eco Preserve. By fitting various models, performing model assessment and selection, I enhanced the predictive capabilities of our analysis. The culmination of this project was the development of a prediction plot, which forecasts future population dynamics, providing valuable insights for conservation efforts. This project emphasized the real-world application of statistical modeling in environmental management, showcasing the power of data-driven decision-making.
