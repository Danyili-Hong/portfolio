## Projects
### - Predictive Modeling and Data-Driven Habitat Management for Small Mammal Populations in Eco Preserve

In this project, I applied advanced data analysis techniques using R to explore and model small mammal population trends for Eco Preserve. By fitting various models, performing model assessment and selection, I enhanced the predictive capabilities of our analysis. The culmination of this project was the development of a prediction plot, which forecasts future population dynamics, providing valuable insights for conservation efforts. This project emphasized the real-world application of statistical modeling in environmental management, showcasing the power of data-driven decision-making.

### - Interactive Data Visualization and Dashboard Design Using Vega-Lite for Multi-Dataset Analysis

In this project, I leveraged Vega-Lite via Altair in Python and R to design interactive and insightful data visualizations, working extensively with JSON and CSV datasets. My visualizations ranged from mapping U.S. airports and choropleth maps of state and county borders to illustrating trends in student performance. These visual tools helped foster data-driven discussions on curriculum enhancements within the department. Additionally, I explored dashboard creation to combine various data insights, offering an interactive platform for deeper analysis. This project strengthened my skills in transforming raw data into meaningful, actionable visual representations.
